**Marathon**

We're delighted to introduce a new event, the awesomest in the history of liantichess: the [antichess marathon!](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/tournament/ZLsdnR8T)

This is a liantichess arena bullet tournament. Except **it lasts 24 hours**. It is a battle of **endurance**, where the will and resistance of players will be put to the proof!

**The winner gets the unique blue globe trophy** on their profile page forever; pretty much like the [Liantichess WC trophy](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/static/images/trophy/acwc21.png). Top fifteen players receive a trophy too!

- **When does it start?** <br/>
This **Saturday 9th April, starting at 4:00 UTC**. See [the marathon page](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/tournament/ZLsdnR8T) for the starting time in your timezone.
