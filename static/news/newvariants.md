**New Variants**

Many New variants are available! The rules are very similar to various lichess variants, the most obvious change being that you must capture. The rules of all antichess variants are very briefly described [here](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/variants).

Currently other variants are planned on discord. So, if you are familiar with these variants and want to help, please do feel free to contribute in [GitHub](https://github.com/SriMethan/Liantichess). If you want to request a variant, you believe would be reasonably popular, you can create a [New Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/SriMethan/Liantichess/issues/new/choose) or suggest it on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5qvjPQstKS). Just keep in mind that our main focus will remain on antichess related games, so all variants other than that will not get implemented.

**Analysis And Fairy Stockfish**

Liantichess now supports Analysis for Antichess and Antichess/Coffee Variants. Do feel free to analyse any game on Liantichess now.

Do note that Liantichess uses a fork of [fairyfishnet](https://github.com/gbtami/fairyfishnet) which you can find [here](https://github.com/TheYoBots/fairyfishnet). So only as long as someone is running it analysis for games in Liantichess will work.
