It's variant time! After the [last 960 Shield](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/tournament/QckWJnum) [AM Александр Штин](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/aleksschtin) manages to win again. Unlike the [previous shield arena](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/tournament/QckWJnum), where the 1st player won with a staggering 50 point difference. The finish here was super close. Maybe this also comes from the nature of the variant, where everyone knows equally much about the opening. Thanks to a 16-game streak ending with a long loss. [AM aleksschtin](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/aleksschtin) manages to take the lead and went from 5th to 1st in the last 30 minutes. Only to finally win by 2 points from [FM arimakat](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/arimakat) and [AIM Kotov_Syndrome](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/Kotov_Syndrome). This makes it his 2nd arena win out of the 2 arenas this year. [AM aleksschtin's](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/aleksschtin) loss didn't work in everybody's favour.

There was a huge Fight between [FM arimakat](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/arimakat) and [AIM cFlour](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/cFlour) to gain the 3rd place but unfortunately [AIM cFlour](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/cFlour) got 4th place and [FM arimakat](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/arimakat) was lifted to 3rd place. [AIM cFlour](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/cFlour) still managed to get top 5 in 960 Arena and had after [FM arimakat](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/@/arimakat) the highest performance in this event.

Antichess960 allows for beautiful attacking games, quick wins and blunders thanks to the confusion. 10.8% of the 62 games got a decisive result within only a few moves. Also our official admin AIM Sarang Sule was berserking most of the game and got 68% berserk rate than others.
