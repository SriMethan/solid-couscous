# Liantichess's database is running out

Liantichess Mongodb database is running out of space, It will delete all your games, and all the user accounts.

Today, I saw and confirmed that the database is fully almost reaching its limit. If it does reach it's limit, I would have create a whole new database for Liantichess and this would delete all user's accounts and games

It had long been known by us moderators and developers that the database would eventually run out. We are tired, bored and disenchanted with trying to find methods to increase it's size. Most recently, the updates to the user interface which allowed analysis in all variants is likely the cause of this crash, but we will reassure you that once the fresh database is created we will not allow such crashes and you will have analysis in all variants. But unfortunately the users accounts and the games even everything is going to be erased within a few days (at this pace 7 days should be the max number of days it will remain).

So its impossible to access old or even recent information's of users, games, tournaments etc. so if the database is out of space, liantichess server may go crazy without any users. Please do feel free to login to Liantichess again once the storage space runs out, and be assured that this will never occur again

Have a good April Fools.
