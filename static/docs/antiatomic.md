# Antiatomic

This is a hybrid variant, which combines the rules of [Antichess](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/variants/antichess) and [Atomic chess](https://lichess.org/variant/atomic). Here, the goal is same as antichess- lose all your pieces or get stalemated to win, but the capture of pieces result in explosions according to atomic rules. 

If this variant is played perfectly from both sides, its a forced draw, as whichever piece captures also gets captured while capturing.
