# ![AntiHoppelpoppel](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/icons/Hoppelpoppel.svg) AntiHoppelPoppel

HoppelPoppel is a modest divergent variant from Germany and AntiHoppelPoppel is a combination of Antichess and HoppelPoppel!

## Rules

The Knights are now Knibis' (moving without capturing as Knights, capturing as Bishops) and the Bishops are now Bisknis (moving as Bishops and capturing as Knights). All other rules are the same as in Antichess must capture is enabled. To win you must loose all your pieces.
