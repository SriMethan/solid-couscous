# Coffeehouse

A hybrid of two variants Antichess and Crazyhouse gives Coffeehouse. The ultimate goal of the game is to checkmate your opponent, but like in Crazyhouse chess the pieces you capture can be dropped back on the board and like in Antichess, pieces must be captured if you can. Slightly different from the hybrid of Antichess and Crazyhouse called [Antihouse](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/variants/antihouse).
