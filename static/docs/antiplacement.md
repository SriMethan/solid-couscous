# ![AntiPlacement](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/icons/placement.svg) AntiPlacement Chess

Pal Benko credited the idea of “Placement-Chess” to David Bronstein.

Different from “Placement Chess” described on [Pychess-Variants](https://www.pychess.org/variants/placement), this variant is simply as Placement chess and modification where players must capture and to win all pieces need to be lost. Castling does not work in Antiplacement as it follows antichess rules.
