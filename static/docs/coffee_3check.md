# Coffee-3Check

A hybrid of two variants Antichess and 3-check gives Coffee_3check. The ultimate goal of the game is to give 3 checks to your opponent's king like in 3-check, but like in antichess the pieces have to be captured when there is a capture. Like in 3-check, a person can also win by checkmate.
