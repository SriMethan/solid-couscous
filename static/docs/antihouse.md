# Antihouse

A hybrid of two variants Antichess and Crazyhouse gives Antihouse. The ultimate goal of the game is to lose all your pieces like how it is in Antichess, but like in Crazyhouse chess the pieces you capture can be dropped back on the board. Slightly different from the hybrid of Antichess and Crazyhouse called [Coffeehouse](https://liantichess.herokuapp.com/variants/coffeehouse).
