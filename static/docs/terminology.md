# Terminology

Throughout the site and in the guides, many different terms are used. Many of these terms are global and apply to all chess variants, some apply to have different implications depending the variant (e.g. stalemate). Any terms that apply to a single variant will be discussed there This page serves as a reference to hopefully clear up any confusion!
